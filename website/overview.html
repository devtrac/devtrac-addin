		<th class="l2">Encryption</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KeePassBB uses the AES encryption algorithm just like the
		desktop version. The encryption key itself is pre-processed by cyclicly 
		re-encrypting and hashing it.  The number of key encryption rounds can greatly
		affect the speed at which the decryption process happens. 600,000
		rounds on a PC will be hardly noticable but on the device it will be
		unbearably slow. The default of 6000 is reasonable.</td>
	</tr>


	<tr>
		<th class="l2">Keyfiles</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The desktop version of KeePass has the concept of keyfiles.
		These are files which contain a key required to decrypt your database.
		Presumably you keep the keyfile on a USB stick that you can remove and
		physically secure. Some users rely solely on the keyfile while others
		use it with a password. When used in conjunction with a password, it
		means that an attacker can't decrypt your database even if he has the
		database file and your password.
		<p>KeePassBB also can use keyfiles but you must be VERY careful.
		If you secure your database with ONLY a keyfile, anyone who picks up
		your BlackBerry will have access to your database. Always use a
		password in conjunction with keyfiles. If you must use keyfiles alone,
		make sure your BlackBerry has a password and the timeout is set for
		the shortest timeout possible.
		<p>You can set a default keyfile in Options. You can also set an
		option to hide the keyfile on the password dialog.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">Database</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Early versions of KeePassBB used a single database stored in
		the device's Persistent Store. This made it difficult for users who
		needed to swap between multiple datbases. From version 1.2 forward,
		databases are stored on the device's filesystem just like any other
		file. This allows you to open and save any number of databases without
		having to import or export. The KeePassBB2 database format is exactly
		the same as the desktop version of KeePass v2. You can copy database
		files back and forth between the device and desktop at will (with one
		exception noted in <b>File System</b> below).
		<p>
		If you wish, you can open a database file directly from a web server
		using the "Open URL" menu item.  The file is retrieved and automatically 
		saved to a file named httpdb.kdbx on the device, then opened.  Changes are
		only made locally.  There's no option to upload the file back to the web server.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">File System</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>All BlackBerrys have a file system, even if they don't have a
		removable SDCard. When you use the KeePassBB File Explorer you'll see
		top-level directories like "/store" or "/SDCard" which are the
		device's internal store and the removable SDCard respectively. With
		BlackBerry OS 4.6 and later, you'll also see a "/system" directory.
		Where you place your files is important to both the Synchronization
		and Backup/Restore processes.
		<p><b>Mass Storage Mode Support: </b>Newer BlackBerry devices that
		have SDCard capability allow the card to be accessed from the desktop
		when the device is plugged into a USB port. When in that mode, the
		device itself no longer has access to the files on the card. In OS 4.6
		and later, the user's home directory "/store/home/user" is also made
		available in this manner even though the directory itself is in the
		device's internal memory. If you store your KeePass files in these
		locations AND you have Mass Storage Mode Support enabled, neither
		Synchronization nor Backup/Restore will work. Safe places to store
		your files are "/store/home/user/keepass" for OS 4.5 and earlier, and
		"/system/keepass" for OS 4.6 and later.
		<p>The BlackBerry file system itself also supports encryption.
		Whenever you create a new file, KeePassBB gives you the option to lock
		the file so that only your device can open it. This applies to both
		keyfiles and databases. Beware though, you will NOT be able to read
		locked files from the desktop or from another BlackBerry. If you
		intend to switch devices, you must remember to do a "Save As" on the
		locked database and uncheck the lock option.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">Synchronization</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KeePassBB can synchronize with KeePass for the desktop using
		the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. The KeePassBB msi package installs an
		add-in to the Desktop Manager to perform the sync. Both the add-in and
		KeePassBB on the device must then be configured to use a specific
		database for synchronization. To configure the desktop add-in, select
		Synchronize then Add-ins. Check the KeePass for BlackBerry add-in to
		enable it, then click Configure to select the database you wish to
		synchronize. On the device, open KeePassBB Options and configure the
		database under Database Options. If you don't configure a database and
		you attempt a sync, a database will be created at
		"/store/home/user/keepass/database.kdbx" on devices with OS 4.5 or
		earlier, or "/system/keepass/database.kdbx" on devices with OS 4.6 or
		later.
		<p>Software version prior to 1.2.1000 required you to open your
		database on the device at least once before synchronizing in order to
		capture the credentials needed to decrypt both the device and desktop
		databases. This is not the case for newer versions.
		<p>When you start synchronization the first time after you start
		the BlackBerry Desktop Manager, you'll be prompted for the credentials
		(password and/or keyfile) to use for the sync process. These
		credentials must be good for both the device and desktop database. The
		credentials and the desktop database are sent to the device for
		decryption and comparison. If changes are detected, they are written
		to both databases which are then saved to the device and back to the
		desktop. The original version of your desktop database will be renamed
		with a ".bak" extension before it's overwritten.
		<p>You won't be prompted for your credentials again as long as you
		leave the Desktop Manager running. If you need to specify new
		credentials, restart the Desktop Manager, or open the Add-In
		configuration page and press the "Reset Credentials" button. You'll be
		prompted again on the next sync.
		<p><b>Sync Criteria:</b> <br>
		<br>
		Entries and groups added to either the device or desktop are pushed to
		the other. <br>
		<br>
		Entries whose last modified times are different (with a 5 second
		buffer) are synchronized such that the entry with the latest last
		modified time wins. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Deletes are NOT synchronized. </b> If an entry is on one platform
		but not on the other, there's no way for me to tell if it was added on
		one or deleted on the other.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Note: </b> The comparison process uses the internal serial numbers
		of the groups and entries instead of the names so if you attempt to
		reconcile a database that was created new on the device with a
		database created new on the desktop, the results may be that groups
		and entries are duplicated on both platforms.

		<th class="l2">Backup and Restore</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The Desktop Manager backup and restore process will process
		KeePassBB databases and program options. For security reasons, it will
		NOT process keyfiles. The back process will only handle one database.
		To configure one for backup and restore, select which database you
		wish to have processed in the program options. If you don't configure
		a database, then a backup will silently fail and a restore will create
		a new database at "/store/home/user/keepass/database.kdbx" on devices
		with OS 4.5 or earlier, or "/system/keepass/database.kdbx" on devices
		with OS 4.6 or later.</td>
