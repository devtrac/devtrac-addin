        <td>A little history... The first version of KeePassBB stored a
            single database in the device's internal persistent store. This was
            pretty stable but had one drawback...you couldn't maintain multiple
            databases as some users had requested. In a subsequent release, I
            changed over from the internal store to using files on the device's
            filesystem. While this satisfied the requirement to manage multiple
            databases, it wreaked havoc on the synchronization process because a
            good portion of the device's filesystem becomes unavailable when the
            devices is plugged into a USB port.
            <p>
                So now I've come full circle. With this release of KeePassBB2,
                I've reverted to the internal store to recover some
                synchronization stability, however, I've left the ability to
                use the filesystem as an option but without synchronization.
                See the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for more information about the
                two modes and how to switch between them.

            <p>
                This release also fixes a font selection bug and a bug where an "!" in a password
                wasn't being passed correctly between the desktop add-in and the device.
