		<th>KeePass for BlackBerry v2 Installation</th>

	<tr>
		<td>Your device MUST be running BlackBerry OS 4.2.2 or greater.
		The application simply will not run on earlier versions of the OS.
		<p>For OTA installation, visit the OTA download link on the home
		page.
		<p>For desktop installation and installation of the Desktop
		Manager Synchronization Add-In, download the .msi file and run it from
		the command line or directly from Windows Explorer. It will install
		the Desktop Manager Synchronization Add-In and extract the cod and alx
		files you'll need to install on the device. Use the Desktop Manager
		Application Loader to get the software into your device. If the
		installation fails, make sure Vista User Account Control is turned off
		and that you're running the install as an administrator. You can turn
		UAC back on again after the install.
		<p>
		<p>When the installation is completed, open the Desktop Manager
		Synchronization tool and go to the Configuration tab. Press the
		Configure Add-Ins button and you should see the Add-In listed. Check
		the box and press the "Configure" button to set the location of your
		KeePass database file.
		<p>If you don't see the Add-In in the Desktop Manager, perform the
		following steps...<br>
		Open a Command Window and navigate to the installation directory,
		usually "c:\Program Files\KeePass for BlackBerry". Now run the
		following command: "regasm /codebase KeePassBB2AddIn.dll". Now restart
		the Desktop Manager.
		<p>The Add-In requires that the Microsoft .NET Runtime v2.0 be
		installed on your desktop. In the unlikely event that you do not
		already have the proper runtime, the installer will download and
		install it for you.
