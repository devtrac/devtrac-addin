<h3>Synchronization Troubleshooting</h3>
<ol>
<li>Make a backup of your database and keyfile and store them in a safe place.
<li>Uninstall KeePassBB from your device.  If you have both v1 and v2 installed, uninstall them both.
You should be prompted to reboot
to complete the uninstall.  If not, pull the battery from your device for a few seconds.
<li>Stop the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and insure your device is NOT plugged in to the PC via USB.
<li>Uninstall the KeePassBB Desktop Manager Add-In from your PC using Add-Remove Programs (or Programs
and Features if on Vista).  If you have both v1 and v2 installed, uninstall both.
<li>Start the Desktop Manager and insure that the KeePassBBAddIn no longer appears
in Synchronize/Configre/Add-Ins.
<li>Close the BlackBerry Desktop Manager again.
<li>Install KeePassBB v2 on the device from the OTA link on the website.  Do not make any configuration changes at this time.
<li>Reboot the device by pulling the battery for a few seconds. The reboot is required to 
register the synchronization process on the device.
<li>Install KeePassBB v2 Desktop Manager Add-In on your PC using the MSI file from the website.
<li>Using KeePass v2.07 on the PC, create a new skeleton database using only a simple, lower case password.
Do NOT use a keyfile at this time.
<li>Open the BlackBerry Desktop Manager and navigate to Synchronize/Configure/Add-Ins.
Ensure that the KeePassBB2 AddIn appears in the list and check the box to enable it.
Uncheck any other Add-Ins (you can re-check them after the test).
<li>With the KeePassBB2 AddIn entry selected, press the Configure button and select the 
skeleton database you created in the earlier step.
<li>Connect the device to a PC USB port.  
<li>In the Desktop Manager Synchronize screen, ensure that only the "Run add-in actions"
box is checked.
<li>Press the Synchronize button.  You should see the progress dialog and get a message stating that 
"No database was found on the device...".
