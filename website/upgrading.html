There is no upgrade path from v1 to v2 on the device.  Use the desktop
version of KeePass to upgrade your databases.
<p>
KeePassBB v1 and KeePassBB v2 are independent programs.  As such, you
can have both installed on your device at the same time.  If you need to open 
both database versions, you'll need to keep both version of the program as
v1 will not read v2 databases and vice-versa.
