		<th class="l2">What does the sync error "Unable to decrypt (device or desktop) database
		using the supplied credentials" mean?
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		When you sync for the first time after starting the desktop manager, you're prompted 
		for a password and/or keyfile to use for the sync process.  The device must be able to decrypt
		both the device and desktop databases using these credentials.  The error indicates that it
		wasn't successful.  
		<p></p>
		Make sure you can open both databases with the same credentials (password alone, or password plus keyfile) 
		then restart the desktop manager and try again.  When prompted, make sure you enter your credentials
		correctly and leave the field for the keyfile empty if you're not using keyfiles.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">What's the difference between Internal and
		External file mode?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KeePassBB2 can store your password database one of two
		ways...in the device's internal PersistentStore (Internal Mode, the
		default), or as a regular file in the device's file system (External
		Mode). There are advantages and disadvantages to each.

		<p>Internal Mode: If you only have one database to manage, this is
		the best solution. The database is stored in the device's internal
		PersistentStore and is accessible only by the KeePassBB program. This
		mode fully supports synchronization using the Desktop manager Add-In.

		<p>External Mode: If you work with multiple databases, this is
		your best solution as you can store multiple databases on your SDCard.
		It does not however, support synchronization using the Desktop Manager
		Add-In. Why? Some parts of the file system, like the SDCard, become
		unavailable when you connect the device to a desktop via USB. This
		causes a Catch-22 situation where you need to use USB to synchronize
		but connecting via USB causes the database file to become unavailable.
		You can, of course, manually copy your database and key files back and
		forth to/from your SDCard using the drive letter assigned by Windows.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">How do I switch between Internal and External
		Mode?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>If you're in internal mode and want to switch to external
		mode, use the "Save As" menu item to save the database to a file, then
		under Options, set "Use External File Mode" to "On". You should now
		close and restart KeePassBB2.
		<p>If you're in external mode and want to switch to internal mode,
		turn "Use External File Mode" to "Off" under Options, then use the
		"Import DB from File" menu item.
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">How do I use a Key File?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Internal Mode: Connect your device to your desktop and copy
		the Key File to your SDCard, then disconnect. On the device, open
		KeePassBB2 and select the "Import Key File" menu ittem, then browse
		your SDCard and select the file. Once imported, this Key File will be
		used for opening existing databases and creating new ones. To delete
		the Key File, select the "Delete Key File" menu item.
		<p>External Mode: Connect your device to your desktop and copy the
		Key File to your SDCard, then disconnect. Reference this file when
		prompted during a database create or open.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">How do I import a database?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Internal Mode: Select either the "Import DB From File" or
		"Import DB From URL" menu items. The file you load will become your
		new internal database.
		<p>External Mode: Select the "Import DB From URL" menu item. The
		file will be downloaded, then saved as "httpdb.kdbx", then opened.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">What encryption algorithms does KeePassBB2
		support?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KeePassBB2 supports the same encryption algorithm as the
		desktop version of KeePass, namely AES-256.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">Is the database format the same as KeePass on the desktop?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yes it is.  You can copy files between KeePassBB and KeePass v2.08 or greater.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">Does KeePassBB2 support user defined fields.</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Version 2 of KeePass introduced the ability to create user defined
		fields for password entries.  KeePassBB2 supports viewing and modifying
		the fields but not the creation of new fields.</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">What does the Desktop Manager Add-In do?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>The Desktop Manager Add-In handles the communication between
		KeePassBB2 on the device and KeePass on the desktop. When you
		synchronize, the add-in sends your desktop database to the device
		where it's compared to, and reconciled with, the device version of the
		database. The databases are then written back to their respective
		sources with the changes, if any.</td>
	</tr>



	<tr>
		<th class="l2">How does Synchronization work?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>KeePassBB2 can synchronize with KeePass for the desktop using
		the BlackBerry Desktop Manager. The KeePassBB2 msi package installs an
		add-in to the Desktop Manager to perform the sync. To configure the desktop add-in, select
		Synchronize then Add-ins. Check the KeePass for BlackBerry add-in to
		enable it, then click Configure to select the database you wish to
		synchronize. 
		
		<p>When you start synchronization the first time after you start
		the BlackBerry Desktop Manager, you'll be prompted for the credentials
		(password and/or keyfile) to use for the sync process. These
		credentials must be good for both the device and desktop database. The
		credentials and the desktop database are sent to the device for
		decryption and comparison. If changes are detected, they are written
		to both databases which are then saved to the device and back to the
		desktop. The original version of your desktop database will be renamed
		with a ".bak" extension before it's overwritten.
		<p>You won't be prompted for your credentials again as long as you
		leave the Desktop Manager running. If you need to specify new
		credentials, restart the Desktop Manager, or open the Add-In
		configuration page and press the "Reset Credentials" button. You'll be
		prompted again on the next sync.
		<p><b>Sync Criteria:</b> <br>
		<br>
		Entries and groups added to either the device or desktop are pushed to
		the other. <br>
		<br>
		Entries whose last modified times are different (with a 5 second
		buffer) are synchronized such that the entry with the latest last
		modified time wins. <br>
		<br>
		<b>Deletes are NOT synchronized. </b> If an entry is on one platform
		but not on the other, there's no way for me to tell if it was added on
		one or deleted on the other.<br>
		<br>
		<b>Note: </b> The comparison process uses the internal serial numbers
		of the groups and entries instead of the names so if you attempt to
		reconcile a database that was created new on the device with a
		database created new on the desktop, the results may be that groups
		and entries are duplicated on both platforms.

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">Why doesn't KeePassBB2 support synchronization of deleted items?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>There's no way to tell if an entry that exists in one database but not the other
		is the result of it being added to the first or deleted from the second.  To be safe, 
		it's assumed that the entry was added.  
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<th class="l2">Are my settings and database backed up?</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
		Internal Mode:  Both the database and your settings are backed up when you 
		perform a Desktop Manager backup.  For security reasons, key files are never backed up.
		<p>
		External Mode:  Your settings are backed up, but backing up the database (or any other
		files on your SDCard) is left to the user.
